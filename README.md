# se_project_spots

A image sharing site.

## Describe

In this project I used html and the BEM method to build a page with images, texts, as well for buttons. For a better expierence, media queries are used order to adjust the elements depending on the size of the screen varing what sort of device a viewer is using. Other details used are importing fonts from different platforms.
